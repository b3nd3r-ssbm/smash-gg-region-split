# smash-gg-region-split
 Split the smash.gg attendees CSV into 4 csvs: East US, West US, Canada, and Mexico!
# Use
## From releases page
 Download the appropriate executable from the Releases page. Then, go to the tournament page, and then settings. From there go to attendees and click Export in the top right corner. Move the CSV that is then downloaded into the same directory as the executable. Run the executable, and that's it! Make sure you only have 1 csv in the directory. The 4 resulting csvs will be in the `out` subfolder!
